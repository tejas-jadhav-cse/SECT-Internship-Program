# SECT Summer Internship Program 1.0 — 2025

**No Experience? No Problem. Let's Change the Game Together.**

---

## 💭 The Real Problem We Faced

Every student has heard it:

> "You need experience to get an internship... but you need an internship to get experience."

We were frustrated.
- Frustrated with rejection.
- Frustrated with scammy internship platforms that ask for money and give nothing real in return.
- Frustrated watching beginner startups struggle to get projects built because they can't afford developer salaries.

## 🔧 So We Built Our Own Solution

What if we could solve both problems at once?

That's how the SECT Summer Internship Program was born.

### 🎯 The Vision

> A completely free, honest, skill-building internship where:
> 
> **Students** (experienced or beginners) get to learn and contribute to real projects.
> 
> **Startups** get passionate developers and designers to build MVPs, websites, automations, and more — at no cost.

- 🏢 **CivoraNexus**
- 💼 **15+ Early-stage Startups** (and growing)
- 👨‍💻 **Open Source Projects** led by student communities

These partners bring real work and we bring the talent and training.

## ⚠️ A Note From the SECT Team

We're starting small but solid. Our goal is to build the most valuable internship experience for students in Tier-2/Tier-3 colleges — not just another "task-based" internship farm.

As we connect with more startups and open source orgs, we'll scale this up.

But those who join this first cohort will always be remembered as the early contributors to a student movement that actually fixes what's broken.

## 📬 Want In?

If you've been:
- Rejected for internships
- Tired of watching fake "internship companies" sell certificates
- Looking to build, learn, and grow for real

Then **SECT Summer Internship Program 1.0** is for you.

We don't care how good your resume is.  
**We care how hungry you are to learn.**
